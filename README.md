Samples of PHP algorithm solutions

Why did I choose these code samples?  They hopefully show fundamentals like problem-solving, logic, organization,
clarity, meaningful names, commenting, etc.  They're hopefully small enough in scope and general enough to be
understood in terms of what problems they're solving and how.  I've stripped out database access and most UI
details.
