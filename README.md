Samples of PHP algorithm solutions

Why did I choose these code samples?  They hopefully show timeless, platform-independent fundamentals like problem-solving, logic, organization, clarity, naming, commenting, etc.  They're hopefully small enough in scope and general enough to be understood in terms of what problems they're solving and how.
